The referral cash will continue to accumulate in your account till it is cashed out. Referral cash is owed by the member offering the reward and in no circumstance must it be assumed that this reward is offered by MintMesh. We are only obligated to offer status points that have no monetary value.</P>

<P class="ft22">time and at its sole discretion, MintMesh reserves the right to change eligibility to receive or give rewards.</P>
<P class="ft23">3.2.2 Referral Rewards and Cash Out.</P>
<P class="ft9">For defined services in the application, Members requesting referrals (requestors) can offer a reward in the form of cash (also called referral cash), that will automatically be awarded to a referrer, once a requestor accepts the transaction. A transaction is defined as a completion of one complete workflow from setting up the request to accepting the referrals provided by a referrer. MintMesh collects a service fee added to the price, to provide members with the referral cash service. Requestors promise to honor payment of referral cash for any Open request that has a response from a referrer and has been accepted by the requestor. It is the responsibility of the requestor to close requests that are no longer relevant or has been fulfilled. Once a referrer has referred an individual and the requestor has accepted the referral, the requestor must pay the referrer, even if the individual being referred has not accepted the connection. Members must cash out all accumulated referral cash before they close the account.</P>

<h3 class="ft5">11. Dispute Resolution</h3>
<P class="ft9">In the interest of resolving disputes between you and MintMesh in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and MintMesh agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and MintMesh are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</P>
<P class="ft9">Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for <NOBR>Consumer-Related</NOBR> Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling <NOBR>1-800-778-7879.</NOBR> To begin an arbitration proceeding, the party that seeks arbitration must send a letter by certified mail, requesting arbitration and describing the claim to the other party. You can send this to us at our registered agent’s address at 12915, Wheatland Road, Fairfax, Virginia</P>
<P class="ft8">22033. In the event that we do not have a physical address for you on file, we may send a notice to you by electronic mail(“Notice”). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and specify the relief sought. We both agree and consent that all good faith efforts will be made to resolve the dispute directly. In the event that we do not reach an agreement within 180 days of the receipt of Notice, MintMesh may take this to arbitration.</P>
<P class="ft17">Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person at a mutually agreed location in Fairfax County, Virginia.</P>
<P class="ft45">We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action<SPAN class="ft46">. </SPAN>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</P>
